Premier League Widget for Ubersicht http://tracesof.net/uebersicht-widgets/

This is based on a widget I found somewhere a long time ago, which stopped working, so I completely re-wrote it. I don't remember where I found the original (not that this contains anything from the original Python code any longer) and I can't find it now. If you come across the old, non-functional one, let me know and I'll credit the original here for giving me the idea.

Anyway, you'll need to visit https://www.footballwebpages.co.uk to sign up for a free account to get an API key. Then open the premier-league.py file in your favorite editor and put your API key in there (where it says **YOUR_API_KEY**).

If you want to color your favorite team, you'll need to change the **MY_TEAM_NAME** variable, and if you want to change the highlight color for your team, look in the index.coffee file for the *mightiest* and *mightyclass* sections.

Then put all this stuff in your local Ubersicht widgets directory. Either git clone the thing or download an archive, it's up to you.
